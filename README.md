Project Title: Enhancing Bennett University's Website with a Student Result Display Feature

Problem Statement:
Bennett University's official website provides various functionalities for students, including academic resources, schedules, and notifications. However, it lacks a dedicated feature for displaying students' academic results, which poses a significant inconvenience for students who need to access their results through alternative methods, such as mobile applications. This project aims to address this gap by creating a frontend clone of the university's website, incorporating a user-friendly result display feature.

Project Description:
The primary objective of this project is to enhance the existing Bennett University website by adding a frontend feature that allows students to view their academic results directly from their desktop browsers. This feature will seamlessly integrate with the current design and functionality of the university's website, ensuring a consistent user experience.

Key Features:

Navigation Bar: A responsive navigation bar that includes the university logo, search functionality, notification icon, and user profile picture.
Result Display Section: A dedicated section where students can view their semester-wise results, including SGPA, course names, and grades.
Responsive Design: The frontend will be designed to be responsive, ensuring accessibility across different devices and screen sizes.
Consistency with Existing Design: The new feature will maintain the visual and functional consistency of the existing university website.
